My first repository

Greetings to whoever is reading this!

My name is Simon and this is my first Git repository. Pretty cool, huh? What, you're not impressed? Well, I'm still new to all of this so I'll probably make much cooler stuff in the future. Big stuff *cue dramatic music*. Oh, cool, I can do italics, too! Im learning so much ^^. Anyways, I'll go now 'cause I have stuff to do. Have a great day! :D
